This is the repository for my course, [Building a Mobile App with AngularJS and Ionic](http://www.lynda.com/AngularJS-tutorials/Building-Mobile-App-AngularJS-Ionic/368920-2.html). The full course is available at [lynda.com](http://lynda.com).

## Course Description
Creating hybrid mobile applications is a great way to leverage your knowledge of web languages like HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. Modern frameworks such as AngularJS and Ionic make it easier with pre-built templates and components. In this course, staff author Ray Villalobos shows how to install the Ionic framework and set up a development environment suitable for building web-based apps. He reviews the core Ionic components: prebuilt, easy-to-use features such as buttons, lists, tabs, and forms. Then Ray shows how to combine these components with Angular.js models, views, and controllers to build a single page app with sliders, pull-to-refresh functionality, and search. The training culminates in building a multi-page app, which you'll learn how to customize with CSS.

## Topics include:
- Installing the development environment on Mac or PC
- Understanding the Ionic templates and CSS components
- Adding IonicIcons to a layout
- Adding tabs, cards, and lists
- Using form elements
- Building a single view app
- Implementing Pull to Refresh
- Creating a multi-tab app
- Styling the applications
- Deploying applications
